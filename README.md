# VulcanBoard

a simple and stable hotkey program for desktop touchscreens.

There are many hotkey solutions and programs like that use either
- physical devices (Elgato StreamDeck) or
- touchscreens (LioranBoard, MacroDeck, StreamPi)

They are often very bloated but lack basic features like asynchronous command execution. They also crash way to often, so especially given their intended use for livestream production that greatly values stability, *VulcanBoard* aims to be a rock-solid alternative.

It is currently still under development, here are some planned changes:
- add extensive config validator
- add documentation for the configuration and use of VulcanBoard
- display error_exits in a gui window
- add list of dependencies
- add gui window to configure keys
- add button merging
- add possibility to choose the font family used for button texts
- add rounded corners
- add fullscreen mode
